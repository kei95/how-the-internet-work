### WAN
 - It is combination of LANs
 - Becaus of this technology, we can ensure that LANs located in different parts of the world communicate as if they were in the same environment
 - Those LANs are connected over the internet as well as other communications.
   - However, connection between two LANs using WAN and regular LANs are different
   - The internet is public Network, means could be seen and modified by others
   - WAN is closed communication using **VPN**.

### VPN
 - VPN is the service that encrypts the data before sends it to one another
 - **VPN Tunnel** is the feature that connects two LANs through special connection to provide anonymity, and security on the internet
   - VPN tunnel is not the physical tunnel between LANs. It's just  a metaphor of high-security communication between two locations
 - VPN that connected between one router to another is called **Site to Site VPN**
 - It's not absolute solution that gives 100% security(There's no such thing)

### End to End Encryption
 - This is the way to send packet that the request get encrypted until it gets to the server
   - Typically Used for internet porches etc
