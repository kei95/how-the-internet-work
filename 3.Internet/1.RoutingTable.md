### Routing table
 - Each router must have a special table called **Routing table**
   - This table tells us which route the packet should choose in order to reach the destination
  - The router learns the packet's destination then it looks at the routing table and learns over which port the packet will be sent
    - This is called **Forwarding**
 - A router always wants to deliver the packet to its destination in the fastest way possible
 - Everything above is done in milliseconds
